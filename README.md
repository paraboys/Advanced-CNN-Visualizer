# Advanced Neural Network with Live Visualizations ðŸš€

## Overview
This project implements an **Advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for **image classification** using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. The model features **real-time loss and accuracy tracking** with dynamic visualizations during training, making it an exciting way to see deep learning in action.

## Features
âœ… **Advanced CNN Architecture** with multiple convolutional layers  
âœ… **Live Training Progress Visualization** for loss and accuracy  
âœ… **Simulated Feature Map Display** for real-time input image visualization  
âœ… **Runs on Google Colab** with GPU acceleration support  

## Setup & Execution
1. Open **Google Colab** and upload the notebook or run the script in Python.  
2. Install dependencies (if needed):
   ```python
   !pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
   ```
3. Train the model and watch **live graphs updating dynamically**!

## Example Output
During training, the following real-time graphs are displayed:
ðŸ“Š **Loss Graph** (Shows how the model improves)  
ðŸ“ˆ **Accuracy Graph** (Tracks training performance)  
ðŸ–¼ **Live Input Image** (Displays real-time training images with class labels)  

## Model Architecture
- **3 Convolutional Layers** with ReLU activation  
- **Max Pooling Layers** for downsampling  
- **Fully Connected Layers** for classification  
- **Dropout Layer** for regularization  
- **Adam Optimizer** with CrossEntropy Loss  

## Results
Achieved **~80% test accuracy** on the **CIFAR-10 dataset**.  

## How to Run the Code
- **On Google Colab**: Upload the script or run the notebook cells sequentially.  
- **Locally**: Ensure `torch`, `torchvision`, and `matplotlib` are installed, then execute the script.
